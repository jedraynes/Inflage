# Inflage

This is a quick bit of code I drafted to visualize actual federal minimum wage versus its inflation-adjusted counterpart as of FY21. I used the [CPI Python Library](https://github.com/datadesk/cpi) to grab the inflation-adjusted values. The actual minimum wage per year was source from the DOL as originally pulled in my project [Dolicious](https://github.com/jedraynes/dolicious).

Data was brought in and analyzed using Python and visualized using Matplotlib.

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, CPI
